# Cultivate

You are a POWERFUL GOD. Or at least you used to be. 
But after losing your cult you were slowly forgotten by the world. Now your only believer being a rather talkative crow.
But a new Person is giving you hope. Could this be your path back to GLORY?

Luckily there is an old PLACE OF WORSHIP nearby.
With a little bit of finesse and a lot of patience you could get your new puppet to SACRIFICE their resources.
Yes, you can feel it already. YOUR POWER IS RETURNING!

But even this is still out of your power. The UNITY EDITOR is used by much wiser and more ancients gods.
Even you marvel in their ability to CODE AND DESIGN A WHOLE GAME IN JUST ONE SEMESTER. Oh, that Power. How sweet it must be!
